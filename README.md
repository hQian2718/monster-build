# Statblock Building app for DND 5E

A GUI application written in Java for writing and rendering statistics blocks.
Comes with statically coded tables that balance encounters for levels 1-20, based on the Angry GM's articles.

Currently working on exporting and importing from other tools, and saving files as markdown.
